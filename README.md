# weekday
Simple python script that takes any date as input and outputs the day of the week for that date.

Note that this relies on the rules set in place by the currently used Gregorian calendar -- thus, any date prior to 
the West's adoption thereof (September 14, 1752) will not be calculated correctly.  

In its current state, the script should accurately place the day of the week for any date from 09/14/1752 to 12/31/9999
